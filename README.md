## About the Project

This project is a mobile application built using React Native. The aim of the project is to provide a seamless and performant user experience on both iOS and Android platforms. Here are the key technologies used in this project:

- **React Native CLI**: For setting up and managing the React Native project.
- **TypeScript**: To provide type safety and improve the development experience.
- **Redux**: For state management, ensuring a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **react-hook-form**: To handle form state and validation in a performant and easy-to-use manner.
